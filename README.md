# VK-Music-Downloader
Simple TUI app made with awesome library [npyscreen](http://npyscreen.readthedocs.io/introduction.html) in Python for everyday use.
## Overview
### Login
Pretty straightforward, the only problem is CAPTCHA: if introduced to user, a url leading to captcha is shown. Moreover, the image itself is downloaded as `captcha.jpg` for convenience.
### Main screen
Also straightforward, with explanation needed only for toggle-choosing songs and modes. To do accordingly, press `x` on your keyboard, while highlighting desired composition(mode).
## Things to do
- Get friends' list of playlists, songs, etc.
- Introduce global (and local) search for musical compositions
- Improve interface (sounds blurry, but OK)
- And maybe an intergrated music played?
